# AGENTS.md — Guide for Development Agents (AI & Human)

## 1. Scope & Context

This document is for all agents (AI or human) involved in the **development, automation, or extension** of the Nexo Dashboard project.
It defines the roles, workflow, compliance rules, and best practices for any contribution, code change, or automation.

---

## 2. Agent Roles in Development

### 2.1. Human Developers

* **Implement:** Build features, fix bugs, or extend functionality in JavaScript/Node.js/Electron.
* **Automate:** Write scripts for Start Menu scanning, data processing, or backup routines.
* **Document:** Update this file, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` for every significant contribution.
* **Test:** Validate all contributions with `npm run start`, automated tests, and code review.

### 2.2. AI/LLM Agents

* **Generate:** Assist with code generation (scripts, modules, helpers), always including comments/attribution.
* **Suggest:** Propose tags, categories, or refactoring for better maintainability.
* **Audit:** Analyze code, suggest compliance or security improvements.
* **Document:** Auto-generate or refine sections of project documentation where requested by human agents.

### 2.3. Automation Agents

* **Integrate:** Set up CI/CD, linting, formatting, or workflow automation for the repository.
* **Validate:** Run automated tests, ensure new code passes all checks, and enforce structure.
* **Monitor:** Backup JSON config files, report errors in sync/scan routines, or monitor repo health.

## 3. Development Workflow

1. **Clone** the repo and set up local environment (`npm install`).
2. **Create a branch** for any change (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, etc).
3. **Make changes** with clear commit messages, referencing issues or feature requests.
4. **Test** all changes locally and, if relevant, with automation (CI).
5. **Update documentation**: AGENTS.md, README.md, and CHANGELOG.md as needed.
6. **Open a pull request** (for human devs) or submit proposed changes via merge request (for AI/automation).

---

## 4. Compliance & Best Practices

* **Attribution:** All code or script changes generated by AI/LLM must include an attribution header:

  ```js
  // Generated by [Agent Name or LLM], 2025
  // For Nexo Dashboard (MIT)
  ```
* **No credentials:** Never commit API keys or personal data.
* **File structure:** Follow the repository’s modular structure. New modules/scripts should fit into `scripts/`, `src/`, or `data/` as appropriate.
* **Testing:** Any major refactor or automation script must be tested in development mode before merge.
* **Documentation:** Update this file and others for any structural or workflow change.
