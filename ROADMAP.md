## 📋 Project Overview

### Solution Context
Nexo Dashboard is part of a modular automation and productivity ecosystem. It focuses on:
- Automatic detection and display of Start Menu apps (Windows)
- Custom/manual entries for portable apps and scripts
- Integration of categorized web bookmarks
- Visual management and filtering via categories/tags
- Easy extensibility for automation and agent workflows

---

## 🚀 Development Methodology

### Standard Development Cycle
```
📝 PLANNING
   ↓
💻 DEVELOPMENT
   ↓
🧪 TESTING (local, automation, UI)
   ↓
📋 DOCUMENTATION
   ↓
💾 GITHUB COMMIT
   ↓
🎯 NEXT PHASE
```

### Success Criteria Per Phase
- ✅ Functional build (`npm run start`, basic UI tested)
- ✅ New features/bugfixes documented (README/CHANGELOG)
- ✅ No regressions: existing features still work
- ✅ JSON/data file structure validated
- ✅ Manual or script-based tests pass

---

## 📊 Project Status
- **Version:** 0.1.0 (initial)
- **Status:** Core architecture and workflow defined; first features under active development
- **Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/nsalvacao/Nexo_Dashboard)

---

## 🎯 Development Phases & Milestones

### ✅ Phase 0: Preparation and Planning (COMPLETED)
**Date:** July 2025
- Project structure created (`assets/`, `data/`, `scripts/`, `src/`)
- Documentation templates (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`)
- Workflow for JSON data sources agreed
- License compliance checked (MIT)

---

### 🚀 Phase 1: Core Functionality & MVP (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal:** Usable dashboard for Start Menu and manual/portable apps

#### Key Deliverables
- [x] `apps_startmenu.json` auto-generated from Start Menu scan (Windows)
- [x] `apps_custom.json` for manual entries
- [ ] Basic dashboard UI: card display, category/tag filter
- [ ] Basic bookmarks integration (load from `links_web.json`)
- [ ] Configurable via JSON only (no UI editing yet)
- [ ] All app launches and bookmarks tested on Windows
- [ ] Core README and usage doc complete

---

### 📋 Phase 2: UI/UX & Manual Management
**Goal:** Visual improvement, add manual editing features

#### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Drag-and-drop or in-app editing for custom apps/bookmarks
- [ ] Visual categories/submenus (two-level navigation)
- [ ] Improved icon support and fallback
- [ ] Responsive UI for various screen sizes
- [ ] Light/Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Search bar with intelligent filtering (category/tag/text)
- [ ] User feedback: success/error toasts

---

### 🧩 Phase 3: Automation & Agent Integration
**Goal:** Enable scripts, agents, and automation for workflow enhancement

#### Key Deliverables
- [ ] CLI commands/scripts for Start Menu scan and backup
- [ ] Automated backups of JSON configs
- [ ] Optional: LLM/AI agent integration for categorization/tag suggestions
- [ ] Extensible hook system for custom automation
- [ ] CI/CD integration for automated builds/tests
- [ ] Developer documentation for automation/agent usage

---

### 🛠️ Phase 4: Advanced Features & Extensibility
**Goal:** Expand dashboard beyond MVP, polish, and prepare for broader use

#### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Plugin/module system for extra integrations
- [ ] Bookmark sync/import from browsers (Edge/Chrome/Firefox)
- [ ] Theming and UI customization options
- [ ] Usage analytics (local, opt-in)
- [ ] Advanced error handling and reporting
- [ ] Export/import functionality for JSON data and settings

---

### 📦 Phase 5: Release Candidate & Distribution
**Goal:** Prepare for public release and user onboarding

#### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Finalize packaging for Windows/macOS/Linux
- [ ] Create onboarding/tutorial documentation
- [ ] Setup issue templates and community support docs
- [ ] Final QA: test builds on all platforms
- [ ] Publish to GitHub Releases

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation Strategy
- Functional check after every phase (`npm run start`, launch all apps/links)
- Manual tests on all supported OS (Win/macOS/Linux, if possible)
- Automated/scripted validation for JSON/data structure
- UI/UX review checklist for new features
- Validation of backup and restore (Phase 3+)
- Peer review before merges

---

## 📋 Risk & Mitigation

### High Risk
- Breaking changes in Electron or Node APIs
- Major OS-specific incompatibilities
- JSON data corruption due to bugs

### Medium Risk
- Third-party dependency changes (npm modules)
- Security issues in scripts or agent integrations

### Low Risk
- UI glitches, minor visual inconsistencies
- Minor documentation errors

#### Mitigation
- Frequent manual and automated testing
- Clear commit/rollback workflow
- Backups of all critical JSON data before updates
